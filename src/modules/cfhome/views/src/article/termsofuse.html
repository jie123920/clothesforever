                            In most cases, any customs or import duties are charged once the parcel reaches its destination country.
                            You may be charged for handling fees and taxes as your order passes through customs. Any charges on a parcel must be paid by the person receiving the parcel (this also applies to retail & wholesale customers).
                            ClothesForever has no control over these charges and we can’t tell you what the cost would be, as customs policies and import duties vary widely from country to country.
                            It might be a good idea to contact your local customs office for current charges before you order, so you are not surprised by charges you were not expecting.<o:p></o:p>
